PSM Notes:

> Scrum definition:
	- a framework for developing & sustaining complex products.
	- not a process or technique for developing prodcuts
	- a framework WITHIN which you can use processes or techniques.

> Scrum components:
	- scrum roles
	- scrum events
	- scrum artifacts

> Rules of scrum:
	- govern the interactions and relationships between scrum roles, events and artifcats.

> Scrum Theory:
	- is based on Empirical process control theory or Empiricism.

> Empiricism: 
	- knowledge comes from experience AND
	- decisions should be based on what is known.

- 3 pillars of Empiricism:
	- Transparency
	- Inspection
	- Adaptation

> 4 formal events in Scrum for Inspection and Adaptation:
	- Sprint Planning
	- Daily Scrum
	- Sprint Review
	- Sprint Retrospective

> Scrum Values:
	- commitment
	- courage
	- focus
	- openess
	- respect

> Scrum Team consists of:
	- Product Owner
	- Development Team
	- Scrum Master

> Scrum teams deliver products
	- incrementally
	- iteratively

> Incremental and Iterative delivery 
	- maximizes opportunities for feedback.
	- ensures potentially useful version of 'Done' product is always available.


> Product Owner:
	- single person, not a committee
	- only person responsible for product Backlog
	- defines features of the product
	- decides on release date and content
	- responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI)
	- prioritizes features according to market value 
	- adjusts features and priority every iteration, as needed  
	- accepts or reject work results

> Development team:
	- is self-organizing
	- has cross-functional skills
	- has the only title of 'Developer' and no other titles
	- individuals within dev team can have specialized skills like testing.

> Dev team size
	- optimal: 3 to 9
	- large teams create too much complexity for an empirical process to manage.

> Scrum Master:
	- represents management to the project
	- responsible for enacting Scrum values and practices
	- removes impediments 
	- ensures the team is fully functional and productive
	- enables close cooperation across all roles and functions
	- shields the team from external interferences
	- serves the product owner find techniques for effective backlog management
